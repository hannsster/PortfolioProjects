# Data Analyst Portfolio - BikeStores Dataset Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio! This repository contains a data analysis project focusing on the BikeStores dataset for the years 2016 to 2018 in the states of TX, NY, and CA. The dataset provides valuable information on revenue, customers, and sellers of certain bike stores (Santa Cruz Bikes, Baldwin Bikes and Rowlett Bikes) across these three states.

## Project Overview
In this project, I explored and analyzed the BikeStores dataset to gain insights into various aspects of the business. The goal was to understand the performance and trends of the stores, identify opportunities for growth, and provide data-driven recommendations for enhancing business strategies.

## Dataset Description
The BikeStores dataset is stored in an Excel file named BikeStores.xlsx and contains the following columns:

- order_id: The unique identifier for each order.
- customers: The name of the customers who made the orders.
- city: The city where the BikeStore is located.
- state: The state where the BikeStore is located (TX, NY, or CA).
- order_date: The date of each order.
- total_units: The total number of bike units sold in each order.
- revenue: The total revenue generated by each store in a given year.
- product_name: The name of the bike product sold.
- category_name: The category to which the bike product belongs.
- store_name: The name of the BikeStore.
- sales_rep: The name of the sales representative handling the order.
- brand_name: The brand of the bikes sold in the store.

## SQL Database
To conduct the analysis, I imported the data into a SQL database using the SQL queries obtained from the [SQL Server Tutorial website](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/load-sample-database/). Specifically, I used the "**BikeStores Sample Database - create objects.sql**" file to create the necessary tables and the "**BikeStores Sample Database - load data.sql**" file to insert the data into the respective tables.

## Tableau Dashboard - BikeStores Analysis
I have created an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of the BikeStores dataset. The dashboard allows you to explore key insights, trends, and performance metrics by filtering data based on the year and state.

The Tableau dashboard includes the following visualizations:

- **Revenue/Year:** A bar chart showing the revenue trend over the years 2016 to 2018, allowing you to identify any significant changes or growth patterns.

- **Top 10 Customers:** A bar chart showcasing the top customers based on their total purchase value, enabling you to understand the most valuable customers to the business.

- **%Revenue/Brand:** A pie chart displaying the distribution of sales across different bike brands, helping you recognize the popularity of various brands.

- **Revenue/State:** A map that visualizes the sales across different states (TX, NY, and CA) to identify the best-performing regions.

- **Revenue/Category:** A stacked bar chart presenting the sales performance by category, allowing you to see which categories contribute most to the revenue.

- **Revenue/Sales Rep:** A bar chart showcasing the top-performing sellers based on their total sales, providing insights into the most successful sales representatives.

Feel free to interact with the dashboard by selecting different years and states to gain a deeper understanding of the BikeStores dataset and explore various business aspects.


## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Cleaning:** The data was already clean from the start, so minimal data cleaning was required in this section. I performed a quick overview of the dataset to ensure data consistency and completeness.

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In the EDA section, I conducted a thorough analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the overall trends, patterns, and distribution of data. Various pivot tables and charts were used to illustrate the findings.

1. **Revenue Analysis:** This section focuses on understanding the revenue trends over the years and across different states. I identified the top-performing stores and analyzed factors that contributed to their success.

1. **Customer Analysis:** In this section, I analyzed the data to identify the top customers based on their total purchase value. The analysis provides insights into the most valuable customers, enabling the business to tailor marketing strategies and enhance customer loyalty.

1. **Seller Analysis:** Here, I studied the data to determine the best-performing sellers based on their total sales. The analysis helps incentivize top-performing sales representatives.

1. **Brand Analysis:** The Brand Analysis section examines the sales performance of different bike brands, helping identify the most popular brands and potential areas for improvement.

1. **Conclusion & Recommendations:** The final section summarizes the key findings of the analysis and presents data-driven recommendations to the BikeStores management for enhancing their business strategies.

## Tools Used
The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel for data exploration, pivot tables, and generating charts. Tableau was used to create visualizations. The data was imported into a SQL database using SQL queries obtained from the [SQL Server Tutorial website](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/load-sample-database/).
